## Steps to run the code from scratch and train the model from scratch
- Click on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cssaivishnu/IR_Repo/blob/scratch/Classifier.ipynb
- Connect to gpu (if available) runtime and select 'run all' from the Runtime option in the menu
- At the end, the model is saved as "classifier.h5" file in the working repository, which can be downloaded for the next step of evaluation

The classifier model can also be downloaded from the link instead of training the model from scratch: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-LQvUGprg5IzMkaWd0c-4PwB9e35lly/view?usp=share_link

## Evaluation of the model
- First download the model from the above link into your local storage
- Click on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cssaivishnu/IR_Repo/blob/main/Evaluation.ipynb
- Upload the model to the session storage **in the working repository** of the colab file opened in the previous step
- Connect to gpu (if available) runtime and select 'run all' from the Runtime option in the menu
- At the end, "Results.xlsx" file will be found in the working directory which contains the evaluated results and metrics
