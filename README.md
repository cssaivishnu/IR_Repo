# E-commerce Clothing Product Categorization with limited data

## Steps to run the code from scratch and train the model from scratch
- Click on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cssaivishnu/IR_Repo/blob/scratch/Classifier.ipynb
- Connect to gpu (if available) runtime and select 'run all' from the Runtime option in the menu
- At the end, the model is saved as "classifier.h5" file in the working repository, which can be downloaded for the next step of evaluation

The classifier model can also be downloaded from the link instead of training the model from scratch: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KV3VJIDYcTBF0WyhmH6DejSauji3OIDp/view?usp=share_link

## Evaluation of the model
- First download the model 'classifier.h5' from the above link into your local storage
- Upload this model to your drive in the main folder "My Drive"
- Click on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cssaivishnu/IR_Repo/blob/main/Evaluation.ipynb
- Connect to gpu (if available) runtime
- Run all the code blocks one by one
- At the end, "Results.xlsx" file will be found in the working directory which contains the evaluated results and metrics

## The working of Demo
- Upload the model 'classifier.h5' to your drive similar to the evaluation step
- Click on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cssaivishnu/IR_Repo/blob/main/Demo.ipynb
- Connect to gpu (if available) runtime
- Run all the code blocks one by one
- At every code block we can see the demo of working of the model for each product category respectively
